echo -e "\n\nSorry but the file you are looking for has been removed. You can still find
Quick WP-CLI on github where it will still be updated and maintained. 

Having Quick WP-CLI only on github allows it to have ZERO association with
Bluehost or other EIG brands, except for what is available publicly on their github pages.

For liablity reasons please know that Quick WP-CLI is a 3rd party script and is in no way* associated with Bluehost or EIG.


To use the script from github you can run the following command:

unset HISTFILE && . <(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rowdya22/Quick-WP-CLI/master/qwpcli)


If you are hesitent to run a 3rd party script please know that Pro Services runs scripts from github and bitbucket as well as private hosting accounts. 

*Pro Services uses Quick WP-CLI"
